# shell
These scripts are used to set up the environment on remote systems to more clearly identify that system when one has ssh'd into that system.  They are written for and tested on debian-based distro but the concept should work on any distro.

## remote_bashrc
This should be copied to the remote system and replace the `.bashrc`.

## ssh_colors.sh
This sets the background and prompt colors, and the terminal title.
